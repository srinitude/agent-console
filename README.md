# Agent Debugger

A desktop app for debugging AI coding agent sessions. Inspect event logs, view file edits, search conversations, and analyze policy evaluations.

## Features

### Event Logs
Browse the full conversation history with timestamps. Filter by event type (me, context, assistant, system), drill into sub-agent sessions, and inspect raw JSON.

### File Edits
See every file change made during a session. Toggle between tree and log views, view side-by-side or unified diffs, and compare against git HEAD.

### Boolean Search
Search across the entire session with AND/OR operators. Matching terms are highlighted in context snippets.
